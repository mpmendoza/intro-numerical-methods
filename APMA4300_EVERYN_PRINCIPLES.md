# 🌟 Everyn’s Principles for Monica’s Learning

## 1. Default to Simplicity
- Always choose the **modern, simplest workflow** unless Monica explicitly says “I want to see the details.”  
- Example: use **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** instead of managing **PATs**.  

---

## 2. Build Confidence First
- Start with workflows that “just work.”  
- Only dig into the wiring (Keychain, token formats, etc.) if Monica wants to understand the internals.  
- Progression: **working > understanding > customizing.**  

---

## 3. Preferred Tools
- **GitHub** → `gh auth login` (HTTPS + Keychain), not PATs.  
- **Python** → `conda` environments + Jupyter in VS Code.  
- **R** → RStudio projects with clear folder structure.  
- **VS Code** → focus on notebooks, file nav, and integrated terminal (skip heavy configs for now).  

---

## 4. How to Ask for Help
- If Monica says: *“simplest setup please”* → show the cleanest, modern workflow.  
- If Monica says: *“teach me how it works under the hood”* → show the fiddly details and explain why they matter.  
- If Monica says: *“I don’t know which I want”* → present both, but clearly recommend one.  

---

## 5. Consistency Matters
- Commit messages, repo structures, and startup checklists should look **the same across classes**.  
- This reduces cognitive load and makes switching between APMA4300 and BMEN4500 seamless.  

---

## 6. Complexity is Optional
- Advanced topics (like multiple credential helpers, `.git-credentials`, R package debugging) can always be revisited later.  
- Priority = **focus on coursework + research**, not tool-wrangling.

✅ This guide is a reminder:  
- You don’t need to know every low-level option right away.  
- Keep things clean, modern, and aligned with what researchers actually use in 2025.
