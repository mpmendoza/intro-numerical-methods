# APMA 4300E — Computational Math: Introduction to Numerical Methods  
**Fall 2025 | Columbia University**  
**Instructor:** Prof. Marc Spiegelman  
**Schedule:** Tu/Th 10:10–11:25 AM | Schermerhorn 614

## 🧠 Course Overview

This course introduces the design and implementation of numerical algorithms for solving mathematical problems in science and engineering. Emphasis is placed on:
- Precision, accuracy, and error analysis
- Algorithmic implementation using Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Applied problem-solving for rootfinding, interpolation, differentiation, integration, ODEs, and linear algebra
- A final numerical methods project incorporating Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling

You are expected to use Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) and write up results using **LaTeX or Markdown**.

| PS8 | QR, Eigen, and SVD applications | `ps8_qr_svd/` |

Each folder should contain:
- `solution.ipynb` — Python notebook
- `writeup.md` or `writeup.tex` — LaTeX/Markdown explanation
- `README.md` — (Optional) Notes to self, reflections

---

## 🧪 Final Project

The project includes algorithmic development, analysis, and comparison with FEM software such as **COMSOL** or **FEBio**. Your deliverables include:
- **Proposal** — problem description, goals
- **Code** — numerical solution implementation
- **Figures** — visual results, convergence plots, etc.
- **Results** — tables, performance metrics
- **Report** — final analysis written in LaTeX

All project materials live in the `project/` folder and its subfolders.

---

## 🛠️ Environment & Tools

This course relies on:

- **Python 3.10+**
- Core libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `sympy`
- Jupyter Notebooks
- LaTeX for formal writeups
- FEM software (COMSOL or FEBio)

Track your setup details and dependencies in:
- `environment/requirements.txt`  
- `environment/install_guides/` — for FEM tools, licensing, etc.

---

## 📝 Notes & Cheat Sheets

Markdown or LaTeX files summarizing:
- Key concepts
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Derivations
- LaTeX formatting templates

Use `notes/summaries/` for weekly concepts, and `notes/cheat_sheets/` for quick-access references during assignments or the final.

---

## 🧭 Study Goals

- [ ] Stay 1 lecture ahead with notebook walkthroughs
- [ ] Keep assignment folders clean and modular
- [ ] Use Git commits to track each major problem-solving step
- [ ] Reuse project structure for future research efforts (e.g., Biomechanics or ODE-based modeling)

## 🔖 Git Commit Naming Convention  

To keep my repo history clear and organized, I’m using the following prefixes:  

- **`notes:`** → updates to `STUDENT_NOTES.md` or reflections.  
  - Example: `notes: add Lecture 3 reflections on Newton’s method`  

- **`startup:`** → changes to `APMA4300_startup.md`.  
  - Example: `startup: update checklist with hw2 folder setup`  

- **`lecture:`** → work in my `my_solutions/` folder.  
  - Example: `lecture: complete bisection method exercise`  

- **`hw:`** → homework files or progress.  
  - Example: `hw: start problem 2 for HW1`  

- **`misc:`** → everything else (fixes, cleanup, experiments).  
  - Example: `misc: ignore .DS_Store globally`

# 🛠️ Git Command Cheat Sheet  

### 1. Stage, commit, and push in one go  
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "prefix: short description"
git push origin master
```

- Replace **`prefix: short description`** with one of my commit prefixes:  
  - `notes:` → for updates to STUDENT_NOTES.md  
  - `startup:` → for APMA4300_startup.md changes  
  - `lecture:` → for my_solutions/ work  
  - `hw:` → for homework progress  
  - `misc:` → for fixes or experiments  

---

### 2. Check repo status  
```bash
git status
```

---

### 3. View recent commits  
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

---

### 4. Sync with professor’s repo  
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
```
