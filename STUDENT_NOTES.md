## üß† Course Overview

This course introduces the design and implementation of numerical algorithms for solving mathematical problems in science and engineering. Emphasis is placed on:
- Precision, accuracy, and error analysis
- Algorithmic implementation using Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Applied problem-solving for rootfinding, interpolation, differentiation, integration, ODEs, and linear algebra
- A final numerical methods project incorporating Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling

You are expected to use Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) and write up results using **LaTeX or Markdown**.

## üß™ Final Project

The project includes algorithmic development, analysis, and comparison with FEM software such as **COMSOL** or **FEBio**. Your deliverables include:
- **Proposal** ‚Äî problem description, goals
- **Code** ‚Äî numerical solution implementation
- **Figures** ‚Äî visual results, convergence plots, etc.
- **Results** ‚Äî tables, performance metrics
- **Report** ‚Äî final analysis written in LaTeX

All project materials live in the `project/` folder and its subfolders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment & Tools

This course relies on:

- **Python 3.10+**
- Core libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `sympy`
- Jupyter Notebooks
- LaTeX for formal writeups
- FEM software (COMSOL or FEBio)

Track your setup details and dependencies in:
- `environment/requirements.txt`  
- `environment/install_guides/` ‚Äî for FEM tools, licensing, etc.

---

## üìù Notes & Cheat Sheets

Markdown or LaTeX files summarizing:
- Key concepts
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Derivations
- LaTeX formatting templates

Use `notes/summaries/` for weekly concepts, and `notes/cheat_sheets/` for quick-access references during assignments or the final.

## üß≠ Study Goals

- [ ] Stay 1 lecture ahead with notebook walkthroughs
- [ ] Keep assignment folders clean and modular
- [ ] Use Git commits to track each major problem-solving step
- [ ] Reuse project structure for future research efforts (e.g., Biomechanics or ODE-based modeling)
